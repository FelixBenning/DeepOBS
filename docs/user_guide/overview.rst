Overview

DeepOBS provides modules and scripts for the full stack required to rapidly, reliably and reproducibly benchmark deep learning optimizers.

Here we briefly described the different levels of automation that DeepOBS provides. While, they are built hierarchically, they can be used separately. For example, one can use just the data loading capabilities of DeepOBS and built a new test problem on top of it.

A more detailed description of the modules and scripts can be found in the API reference section.
